## Examples

- [1-nodemon-example](https://github.com/ashleydavis/live-reload-examples/tree/main/1-nodemon-example) - This is the simplest possible example of using [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) for live reload of a Node.js JavaScript application.
- [2-nodemon-example-with-config](https://github.com/ashleydavis/live-reload-examples/tree/main/2-nodemon-example-with-config) - This is an example of using [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) for live reload of a Node.js JavaScript application, this time configuration is provided via the `nodemon.json` configuration file.
- [3-nodemon-example-with-typescript](https://github.com/ashleydavis/live-reload-examples/tree/main/2-nodemon-example-with-config) - This is an example of using [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) and [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) for live reload of a Node.js TypeScript application.
- [4-automated-testing-example](https://github.com/ashleydavis/live-reload-examples/tree/main/4-automated-testing-example) - This is an example of automated tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in "watch mode" so your tests automatically reload as you are changing your code.
- [5-automated-testing-with-typescript](https://github.com/ashleydavis/live-reload-examples/tree/main/5-automated-testing-with-typescript) - This is an example of automated tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in "watch mode" so your TypeScript tests automatically reload as you edit your code.

To try these examples you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then clone this repo and follow the instructions in README.md in each subdirectory.
